# 🥑 AguacAIte-Labs

AguacAIte is a machine learning and deep learning framework for detecting tuberculosis in chest X-ray images.  
The project compares classical ML baselines with modern convolutional neural networks and transfer learning architectures, providing both quantitative metrics and visual interpretability through Grad-CAM.
